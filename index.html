      <h4>Dear Ava,</h4>
      <p>
        When I disappeared during the electricity died I was really stressed
        about the FYP. I fucked up I lost all my confidence and just broke down
        and did alot of irrational things like breaking up, quitting my job, not
        going to social events, not getting out of bed, sleeping all the time
        and that made my parents scared and forced me to go to therap and that
        made my parents scared and forced me to go to therapy. During therapy
        they put me on an anti-depressant called Prozac. I had to take 80mg of
        Prozac and the drug did help me with getting out of bed and stuff like
        that but I couldn't feel anything. I couldn't cry, laugh, get hurt or
        feel enoyment in doing things that I used to like thats why whenever you
        asked me how I felt about you I genuinely didn't know.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was really weird to think about things that normally made you feel
        something. I stalked you everytime you streamed or tweeted, stalked your
        likes because I just wanted to know what you were up to. I wanted to
        know that you were doing things and getting over someone like me. I
        genuinely thought that I wasn't good enough for anything and specially
        to be your boyfriend or even husband. Later on the dosage of Prozac was
        decreased from 80mg to 40mg. I still feel numb but not as much as
        before. Around that time is when I saw the dream and I realized that I
        missed you. I wanted to say something but I didn't have the balls to do
        it (you have bigger balls than me ngl). I wanted to tell you but all the
        excuses not to came in my head. Whenever you streamed and I saw you
        happy without me, I just thought that I was holding you back.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really want you. You might not think so or can't trust that but to me
        you are special. I will always think about you and I want us again
        because it is the only thing that was on my mind. NO MORE EXCUSES I'M
        GONNA BE YOUR LIL BOO THANG.
